# Research Mind-Map Tool Pro

> **Think → Write → Structure → Visualize → Export**

Research Mind-Map Tool Pro is a **thinking-first learning system** designed to help you **understand deeply**, not just collect notes.
It transforms reading and writing into **structured knowledge + visual memory**.

This is **not an AI shortcut tool**.
It is a **cognitive amplifier**.

## Why This Tool Exists

Most tools:

* Encourage copy–paste ❌
* Produce shallow notes ❌
* Don’t show *how well* you understand ❌

This tool:

* Forces **active reading**
* Requires **own-word synthesis**
* Converts thinking into **structured JSON**
* Visualizes knowledge as a **mind-map**
* Tracks **depth of understanding** using **Bloom’s Taxonomy**

---

## Core Features

###  1. Discovery (Keyword → Trusted Sources)

* Enter a keyword (e.g., *Cybersecurity*)
* Automatically generates **trusted learning links**

  * Wikipedia
  * Cloudflare Learning
  * IBM Topics
  * MIT OpenCourseWare
  * ArXiv
  * YouTube
  * StackOverflow
* Add your own custom URLs
* One-click copy support

---

### 2. Research (Active Reading)

* Dedicated space for **manual reading notes**
* Guided critical-reading checklist
* Notes are **saved locally** (no cloud, no tracking)

---

###  3. Synthesis (Your Own Words → JSON)

* Write your understanding in **plain language**
* Tool extracts:

  * Topic
  * Definition
  * Core concepts
  * Risks
  * Controls
  * Benefits
  * Key points
  * Why it matters
* Generates **structured JSON**
* JSON ↔ Text **two-way sync**
* Built-in JSON validation
* Word & concept statistics

---

### 4. Interactive Mind-Map

* Render JSON into an **interactive visual mind-map**
* Features:

  * Expand / collapse nodes
  * Drag & rearrange concepts
  * Search & highlight nodes
  * Node depth visualization
  * Branch counters
* Bloom’s Taxonomy tagging:

  * Remember
  * Understand
  * Apply
  * Analyze
  * Evaluate
  * Create

---

### Learning Analytics

* Progress bar across stages
* Node count
* Concept depth
* Branch complexity
* Word & concept counts

---

### Export & Persistence

* Export as:

  * JSON
  * HTML
  * Plain text
* Save & load progress (LocalStorage)
* No backend required
* Fully offline-capable

---

## Philosophy (Very Important)

This tool follows **learning science principles**:

* **Feynman Technique** → explain in your own words
* **Cognitive Load Reduction** → structured JSON
* **Dual Coding Theory** → text + visual map
* **Metacognition** → Bloom’s level awareness
* **Active Recall > Passive Reading**

If you can’t write it → you don’t understand it.

---

## Tech Stack

* **HTML5** (single-file app)
* **CSS3** (modern UI, dark mode)
* **Vanilla JavaScript**
* **LocalStorage** for persistence

No frameworks.
No dependencies.
No backend.

## Final Note

This tool is not about **speed**.
It is about **clarity**.

> *Understanding beats memorization.
> Structure beats noise.
> Thinking beats tools.*
